title: Introduction to AWS
---
These are the slides of a talk I gave for the october 2015 Grenoble Human Talks. 

The aim of this talk was to answer to very simple questions:

* what is Amazon Web Services ?
* what can I do with it?
* how can I use it?

The slides were applied to a real-life business case: the hosting of <a href="https://www.monaviscompte.fr" target="_blank">monaviscompte.fr</a>.

Sorry, but they are in French!
