title: Improve your email deliverability
---
These are the slides of a talk I gave for the march 2016 Grenoble Human Talks. 

The aim of this talk was to present a few good practices and hints to improve the deliverability of the emails you send.

Most of them are just common sense but used all together they can make you safe about your sender reputation!
