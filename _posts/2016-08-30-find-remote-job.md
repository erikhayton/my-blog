title: Resources to find a remote job
---
A few months ago, I decided to quit my job at Citizen Republic to get a new position. I had many reasons to change, but one of the most important was I really wanted to know what it was like to work remotely. I don't mean working from home time-to-time for convenience, but really work for a company where offices and face-to-face meetings do not exist.

I think the folks at <a href="https://37signals.com/remote" target="_blank">37 Signals</a> really convinced me ;)

The fact is, in France, remote working is not so frequent, and traditional job boards French developers usually use (RemixJobs and AzertyJobs ahead) do not offer a "remote" criteria. So I just wanted to share this list of job boards referencing open remote positions or at least a "remote" criteria. They have helped me a lot during my search:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://weworkremotely.com" target="_blank">We Work Remotely</a>, supported by Jason Fried and his crew</li>
	<li><a href="http://jobs.remotive.io" target="_blank">Remotive</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs" target="_blank">Remote|ok</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://angel.co" target="_blank">Angel List</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.jobsintech.io" target="_blank">Jobs In Tech</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.workingnomads.co/jobs" target="_blank">Working Nomads</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs" target="_blank">StackOverflow | Jobs</a></li>
</ul>

You should also definitely have a look at <a href="https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job" target="_blank">Awesome Remote Job</a>, a GitHub repo curating a lot of resources about remote jobs.

Needless to say, my preference goes to We Work Remotely as this is where I finally found my current (remote, of course) position at <a href="https://emailhunter.co" target="_blank">EmailHunter.co</a>.

A BIG thank you to the guys behind each of this websites, you really made my life better!
