title: Bug Bounty Program
---
These are the slides of a talk I gave for the december 2016 Grenoble Human Talks.

The aim of this talk was to present the ideas behind bug bounty programs, and to
present the results we get with the program we set at Hunter.io.

*Disclaimer:* We were really satisfied with the results!
